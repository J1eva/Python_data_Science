Stock Market Prediction using Yahoo and Google Dataset
Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive project on stock market prediction using datasets from Yahoo Finance and Google. The project aims to leverage historical stock price data to build predictive models capable of forecasting future stock prices. The repository includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model implementation using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

Features
Data Collection: Scripts to fetch historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance and Google.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization, and feature scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical analysis to understand data patterns and trends.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features to enhance model performance.
Model Building: Implementing various predictive models including:
Linear Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forest
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
Model Evaluation: Metrics to evaluate model performance including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Deployment: Code for deploying the model using a web framework for real-time predictions.
