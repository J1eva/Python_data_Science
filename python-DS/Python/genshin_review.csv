6,5.0,"This is one my first Open World RPG games, and I think I never have loved a game as much as this... The graphics, character designs, the waifus are all amazing, even the story is kinda good... But the updates are dry and the content is not enough when one is at endgame, so hv recently been burnt out. I would love it if they devs can think of a way to entice old players to stay. Also give better rewards man.",4

8,7.0,I keep trying to play but it keeps on saying there is some type of error on it it wasn't worth it!,1
9,8.0,"Love the exploration (Except the whole of sumeru), the lore is good, the character designs are just getting better & better! But, u need to give out better rewards, the primogems are not enough! Plus the grind is always repetitive, artifact system sucks, abyss rewards needs to be raised, lack of end game content, and the quests are BORING! The quests are too lengthy and most of the time, uninteresting. Please add dialogue and/or a skip button!",1

15,14.0,"I love it sm. The story is literally awesome!!! I also love the fact about all the theories you can make. I also love and respect how they have made so the gods (the archons) have devil names from the ars goetia. That's just a cool detail i noticed not a while ago.

21,20.0,"Been playing for almost 3 years now and the gaming experience is still awesome. Story line is also good. Just a small request to the devs 😊, hope you guys can add different zoom angles, especially wide angles on all gaming platforms. This would definitely help a lot and also to enjoy the scenery more if roaming the region on a wide screen perspective. Thank you.",5

37,36.0,Worst game in my life yes it's number 1 game but most worst number 1 game don't download it it's so lag,1
38,37.0,Fun,5
39,38.0,I like genshin because of the lore usually games like that are more focused on like main history events like french revolution and put it in they're way into the game but with genshin the difference it's that they put stuff like Peniheri into it what's based on a real life book from the 1500s I like that underrated stuff of history and I like that hoyoverse puts it into the game I do like the game design too,5
40,39.0,Cool but I wish the game whould a lot smaller the game seems like a trial for 9 days couse of the updates,4

47,46.0,My review did not get accommodated and it didn't get responded to. The issues are still here after all the customer service told me to do I think it's the games problem not my phone or internet. I hope your employees can at least respend to people's reviews and fix the games issues. I hope my review can help the game and potentially other people. Thanks!,1

55,54.0,"Not able to sign in , i uninstalled every extra apps but still an error was coming nerver downloading ever again",1
56,55.0,"There is a reason this game has fallen to 3 STARS and it's going even lower every time I see it. YOU keep deleting special content and time gate content. New players have no clue. Also, there is no Android phone optimization even tho the s24 is dedicated to handle this game. ""New"" boring and bloated content and dialog is the same. Why keep the annoying sidekick...? Weathering Waves story and characters seem more promising and that game isn't even out yet. Create different race characters!!!",1
57,56.0,Became my most fav game yesss,5
58,57.0,Used to be fun but there's not really a lot of things to do anymore. I was able to reach AR 60 after playing for 2 years and a half once I've reached AR 55 the motivation/ fun if playing the game has already faded now I'm only playing because I've spent too much money and time playing this game.,3
59,58.0,The game is great and so is the story line but I really wanna see more of the anime still art.And i feel like the travel speak instead of piamon since I feel like it would give a bit more depth in the game other than that the games amazing and I recommend playing,4

67,66.0,"1. The story, characters, world and music - great, love it very much 2. Gacha is greedy, in-game rewards are not enough. I buy BP and welkin but still think that game can offer more 4. Endgame is boring, it's better to quit from time to time and come back for the new regions 5. At least they are making interesting events each update 6. They still work with russia, which means they contribute to russia tax system, where money are used in missile production and you know what happens next",3
68,67.0,10/10 the best game ever that I have played,5
69,68.0,Such a cool rpg game Might even be the best! But it has lots of pay2win options and I'm free2play tho..,5
70,69.0,"won't talk about the rewards since it needs 6 pages itself, but I will talk about the insane problems. Look, genshin doesn't need to try anymore. Bugs that were in during the first patch are still there, there are almost no quality of life features, everyone has been asking for artifact load outs and it never came until the early 4.0+ patches. The recommendations as well weren't there until new patches. So many bugs/glitches that were there since day 1, the strongbox is a scam, fix your issues.",1

78,77.0,Been a player since 2020. Truly a wonderful anime game. it has so many big places to explore like sumeru & liyue and u can play it 24/7,5
79,78.0,作为一款手游界创世神作，如今却成功教会了我放下游戏出门，很好奇原神策划是怎么做到的？肯定不只是周年庆送三抽和负面事件一出就躺平这么简单吧~肯定还会有过人的技巧比如出那维莱特把环境搞烂然后再继续抑制早已爆炸的数值膨胀吧~肯定还会有出色的能力比如枫丹的主角实力疯狂正常发挥然后说出来的台词根本和玩家达不成共鸣吧~......如今是领悟了一个道理，别看深渊就行了，角色喜欢就抽抽不到就躺，绝对玩得开心,2
80,79.0,"To get stronger you need luck and money, not skill and strategy. Hoyoverse is so stingy with rewards, all the comments and suggestions that genshin players made is put not on genshin, BUT ON HONKAI STAR RAIL. This is ridiculous, why bother asking players to answer surveys then? And you only give mora as a reward. Afk legends has better rewards, they give gems for survey rewards. Genshin only gives 1 primogem for tutorials, afk legends gives 30. You're NOT gonna get bankrupt from giving more",1
81,80.0,This game is the absolute best! But just 1 big problem made this review lose 4 stars! After a play a little I cannot play! It automatically kicks me out of the game! Now I am thinking why did I use 33 GB storage just for this stupid game! 🤬,1

And I know grinding is a thing but sometimes I feel like it takes to long.And again, if you like it then good for you.",4
86,85.0,"Once you have unlocked a character ..there must be another way of unlocking his constellations, rather than wishing ...like you can have character based quests ...with several chapters with difficulty based levels...otherwise its just a money oriented game..where we have to be at mercy of gacha system ..to even dupe the characters which we already have.. Solution is ..for important constellations ..like c1 and c2 or even c3 ..you should give through ingame content and rest of them can be gacha",1

223,222.0,"Frustrated with the wish/pity system, especially when it comes to spending. I feel like if I'm dropping $40 on the game, getting the 5* should be guaranteed. Motivation to play the game has completely gone down as well, it feels like after a while there's no motivation to log on and do tasks every day, and the main quests get too long for me to play day-to-day.

304,303.0,Very,5
305,304.0,The game has a lot of potential but Mihoyo refuses to let it see it's potential. There is no content in which to use the characters you collect because of a lack of endgame and how stupidly easy everything is on the overworld. They lock lore and important story behind LTE's. They haven't updated the weapon banner to be like HSR's which is far superior. Tedious Dailies (let us just spend resin to finish them already). It's been years and they still haven't listened to the community.,1

The other problem is that most of the locations aren't very different from each other, of course there are some really beautiful ones, but it's rare. The last issue is the combat because you often forget about the elemental system and the characters doesn't play much different from each other.",2

This game has had zero improvement on playability and I don't mean that it doesn't work but you gotta pay to enjoy and even then you still end up with the short stick when you are unable to get powerful enough characters and equip... think I'll stick to WOTV FFBE over this rubbish where you potentially get what you work/pull for.,1

So far they only have had one 4 star hp sword and it was for a limited time. Also the game is super grindy you will have to log in every day maybe even twice if you want to progress. The artifact system is the worst you can go months without getting 2 EM ones from a set. So if you want to play nahida or kazuha your in pain. Takes one week to level up 1 artifact!!",5

448,447.0,"game was fun during its initial stage, lots to explore, characters to build, etc. After a while, the game is rather repetitive. Your team can easily kills anything in the overworld.

564,563.0,"I've played this game for 100s of hours and I can say I only enjoyed a few hours of gameplay. The characters, graphics, art, and cutscenes in this game is beautiful. Collecting characters is a nightmare unless you have 60-120 dollars everytime you're interested in a character. It takes hours of bosses, grinding, and collecting just to build a single character so no you can't play with the character right after getting it. The quests are dreadful. 500 letters is not enough to explain how this gam",1
565,564.0,I like the game but you should be able to lower the world level more than once because as a new I just worked on my adventure rank and now I can't really beat anything. The game also needs a selling system like breath of the wild where can sell anything you're not going to use to get Mora easier because it a big part of the game as you need is level and ascend character plus you also need it to level up weapons and artifacts.,3
566,565.0,"This game has beautiful graphics, characters, scenes, and has great storyline too! I've been playing a lot since I joined like, two months ago maybe? I've been hooked ever since, this game is just so much fun! I only wish there was more to do in co-op mode.",5
567,566.0,"Okay, I think this is the most fun game ever, tbh but the only reason I gave it 3 stars I it uses a lot of space, which I had no choice but to uninstall it.

On April 24rd 2022 I believe was the day I downloaded genshin. I loved playing, I was addicted to the game but with time it just got too much. The events are super fun to play, the stories are a but tiring but also interesting. Building characters was one of my favourites. But everything has an end. Goodbye genshin, thanks for this fun time❤️🙏🏼",5

582,581.0,I like this game,5
583,582.0,Great game with good graphics and content but I can't progress quickly because of it's repetetive gameplay content. Even though I completed many missions they keep appearing everytime I pass through that area.

Everything at Genshin impact literally takes over Honkai Star Rail,the thing is it's the rewards that don't take Genshin over Hsr. It's really unfair for Hoyoverse to give less rewards to the game that actually helped the company. Although at least Genshin has no racist character unlike some character Hsr named ""Sparke""...Ew",4

621,620.0,I like the game so much But my phone couldn't handle the storage i wish that you could maybe just give us a right amount so That many people could download the app,4
622,621.0,"Now,I've been playing genshin for a while now, for about 3 weeks and 4 days.I have this idea in my mind and it kills me not to ask this to you. Why does characters with ya know, elements, cool elements in fact,but why do they get damaged by their own elements? Like, my point is why not make them immune to their own elements or just make the damage absorbed less critical if the enemy has the same element as the character?Don't hate me, i just want to express my idea good luck for your development",5

723,722.0,First of all the story line is not bad and the graphics is pretty good the game has a smooth feeling to it and offers great exploration since it's open world and I like the puzzles you find around the world and each area has it's own mechanisms and features that differs from the others and if I had to point what I like the most about it the beautiful world and puzzles there are to uncover the explanation is the best factor of this game and I love it.,4

740,739.0,"ill keep this short 1) Bad Artifact grinding. theres 3 layers of RNG. hoping to get the artefact set you want, the stat and substat, and finally hoping it rolls into the substat you want it to 2) bad rewards and gacha system. even hoyos other games have proven to have better gacha system with more rewards for players to earn each patch 3) lack of endgame content. Abyss is the only meaningful endgame content, there is virtually nothing to do if you've 100% all regions and done all quests",1

794,793.0,"Been playing since launch and to me, there's literally nothing to be hyped for except the new characters. It's getting stale and it has been like this ever since Sumeru. Story progression is too slow. Storytelling is just plain bad and full of uneccesary dialogues you'll fall asleep when reading. TCG that no one cares about. QoL updates that takes ages to implement. Most ingame mechanics are just there to stretch your game time but are boring and annoying. SA is the only endgame.. List goes on.",2

Low amount of energy for dungeons. Very low percentage on artifact generating crit numbers. Elemental cups almost non existent may take months to find. Lot of characters to play. Choose ur waifus or husband and wiggle around the continent. Map is enormous could get some mounts for faster movement. But very fun to play.",5
803,802.0,"First of all, this is the best game I've ever played. The story is very long and still in development, the events have various options. The graphics are on a different level. So if anybody writes a review about how they like it but gives 1 star, then cry about the lag, get a better device. If you can't, then it's not meant for you to play, sorry. The lag is because of the quality of the game, the developers are going for quality. It's not their fault that the game can't run on a hairdryer. <3",5

841,840.0,It is a good game .. i like it a lot .. but the thing is .. i am playing in my android .. and hopefully .. they will grant us our wish that we can play in our controller like i phone does ..,3
842,841.0,"Player since day 1. Was fun to start, logged in daily. Now I barely log in at all. The motivation to explore is nearly gone. There's no challenge modes aside from the abyss. It's just too repetitive. The writing, mainly voiced cutscenes and character animations, can be jarring at times and ruins the immersion. Like most games, feedback you give is useless. There still is no controller support for Android. It's been years now. Compared to Star Rail, this feels like you get less for more.",3
843,842.0,I like it very much but when we get in the water area where the water god is I don't know what the element is called but the main problem is that when I go out to swim in other areas in the reason why I am telling this is because I already lost my other account so when I go to swim in another area I can't so fix that and we can swim in any area that has water please,1

I'm playing this on max graphics on the samsung galaxy fold 5 and it's simply amazing with the screen folded out. Controls are so easy to use, the graphics are incredible and the open world gives me countless hours of playback. I'm playing this at every opportunity I get and I've not touched another game on my phone since I got this. The last time I got hooked to a game like this was when skyrim came out.",5
880,879.0,Is awesome is great the design is very cool and it acts like a very good anime games my only problem is that on mobile it lasts a lot and sometimes it won't even let me play other than that it's a good game.,5

909,908.0,"Playing GI very exhausted sometimes. Grinding sht, daily sht, and losing gacha. And then i saw how u, hoyoverse, handle the critics like that. I feel like sht that always expect new features. Lv100, 200resin, extension abyss floor, etc. It seems like, what u, hoyoverse care rn is marketing new characters and gain big profit. New Patch just to keep player dont runaway. And mostly boring.",1
910,909.0,Pengembangnya kikir saya tidak suka,1
911,910.0,"Over a year this game become boring to me because of when you finish all of the story quest, explored the map, open all the chest etc. I wish that they always release a new archon quest in every update so us who play this don't get bored especially ar60 players",4
912,911.0,I hope it takes a little less space then it does.,4
913,912.0,As a free to play player it's a bit troubling knowing there are other people who can pay there way thru the game but it's really easy to stay invested and play for hours and I was at somepoint someone who thought this game was stupid but now I relise him fun and how much time I can put into this game.,4
914,913.0,"Genshin Impact, hailed for its visuals and gameplay, falls short due to its predatory gacha system, lack of meaningful endgame content, restrictive resin system, shallow storytelling, limited multiplayer features, performance issues, and profit-driven monetization. The game's emphasis on expensive microtransactions, repetitive tasks, and unfulfilling narrative arcs creates a pay-to-win environment, fosters player burnout, and fails to deliver a truly immersive and satisfying gaming experience.",1
915,914.0,GREAT APP.,5
916,915.0,Easily the absolute best mobile game ever. Everything about this game is so amazing. The story is decent I would say. It has a very big map and u can explore Soo much also it is open world. U don't exactly need money to play this game u can play it without paying at all like me. There is however a major issue that is the ping pls hoyo create a better server for Asia we need more asian servers it is always above 170- 300 even though my wi fi is rly good. Pls this game would be perfect with that.,5
917,916.0,It was soooooo fun,5
918,917.0,"This game could be pretty fun but so many downsides in the game... Such as the excessive amount of storage, the underwhelming lack of endgame content, the bad wishing system and artifact system, how difficult it is to level up your characters, and the overall lack of content. It seems good at first then it just feels like it's not enough, and the requests made by players that still aren't introduced like more resin, skip button, more QoL updates etc. It's unlikely but I hope they listen to us.",1
919,918.0,Idk I just like it,5
920,919.0,👍👍,5
921,920.0,This is a overall good game but the main prob is getting primos and I like it make me sometime feel bad for not getting anything and doing so much hard work and the daily commission is like doing daily homework it make me stressed,4
922,921.0,"Trash enemies can stop you in the middle of attacks but you can't stop them. World Leveling makes enemies stronger than you and in many cases unkillable. No way to change difficulty until reaching world 5, but you don't have powerful characters or equipment to survive. Bosses also summons enemies that you can't reach. Are you guys for real? Caps character level but makes enemies 10+ level stronger? Recommended level for dungeon bosses is false. If you have no money, don't play this game.",1
923,922.0,"Loved it. There were a few silly bugs, but they were fixed. The story is good, and the character designs are even better",5
924,923.0,"This game gives me depression.The graphics are ok,but it's really hard to get to level 20 or 30 to continue the main story.Kinda dissapointing....and it makes me cry,i love the charackters so much,but the chances to get them are REALLY low....",1
